## What should I use?

Tired of looking into thousands of Twikis to understand which dataset/json/calibration/whatnot to include in my analysis I started this page to keep track of everything. 

The data is contained in the /json directory in json format, because it's 2019 and a machine-readable format is needed.
The data contained in the jsons are converted into this fancy markdown webpage with a python script, because I am a bad web programmer and I only got as far as static pages.
